# LearnedLeague
Data visualizations for LearnedLeague, an online trivia community

I'm initializing this repository with some png files based on data from what, as of 4/7/2021, is the latest season of LearnedLeague trivia, LL88.
My goals are to answer the following questions:

1. Which league has the highest defensive efficiency? Which branch?
2. Do leagues with higher QPct tend to have higher DE as well?
3. Which D Rundles are outperforming A Rundles, if any?
4. Is it more important to know obscure facts or to apply defense well (OE vs. DE)?
5. What number of TCA do you need in order to be C Rundle material?

I also hope to maake a table of TCA over time for the league to do some projections based on past performance. For this, I may use Excel or Python.

(Thanks for GrzesiakJ for giving me his Excel file of CA% data midway through LL88 so I could add to it from that point forward.)
